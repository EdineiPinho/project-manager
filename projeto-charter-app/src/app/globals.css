/* 
  Base styles are primarily handled by Tailwind's preflight 
  and utility classes applied in layout.tsx and other components.

  The Geist font variables are set in layout.tsx and applied to the body.
  Background and text colors are also set in layout.tsx using Tailwind classes.

  Any truly global base styles (e.g., for specific HTML elements not covered
  by preflight or needing overrides) could be added here, but for now,
  we'll keep it minimal to let Tailwind and component-level styling take precedence.
*/

/* Example of a global style if needed:
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
*/
